Web/Mobile/Touch User Interface Engineering: (Design and Front End Development)<br><br>

I bring a unique hybrid of applying passion and strength to both Digital Design and Web/Mobile Development. I enjoy creative coding, designing and developing best in class UI. I adopt a device and screen agnostic approach using a holistic combination of both design, and development. My approach is adaptive and performant.<br>
I constantly involve myself in the web and mobile development community. You can find me active on GitHub, Stack Overflow, and various JS focused communities.<br>
I'm software/tool/framework agnostic. I use the best tool for the job, and enthusiastically test new patterns and solutions as they distribute throughout the developer community.<br><br>


Rapid screen adaptive and responsive prototyping, web or mobile front end build using:<br><br>

Bootstrap, Foundation, Material Design, Polymer, GSAP, Velocity, Famo.us, Node, Express, Socket io, Angular, Ionic<br>
Custom HTML5 + all related technologies (CSS3 with performance, power consumption, and GPU optimizations)<br>
Custom OO JS using vanilla, jQuery, Async libs, _lowdash, Angular, Ember, Backbone, Knockout, React, MEAN stack, Ionic<br>
Web Components using Polymer, Ember, React<br>
Mobile Specific: Ionic + Angular, Famo.us, xCode + Swift + Cocoa2d/3D, Android UI using Android IDE + Java + XML (I am currently working on mastering native iOS and Android development (not web, native applications: until then, I can use the native mobile libraries to build native UI prototypes).<br>
Wordpress customization and theming without plugins (native core WP + PHP)<br><br>


Front End Technologies<br><br>

HTML5 (DOM, BOM, APIs [cache, storage, history, audio, video])<br>
JavaScript using Doug Crockford enhancement, A Osamni patterns and frequently engage the authors of the<br>
most popular client side SPA frameworks. I'm currently working on Ember demos and updated documentation<br>
Async / AJAX or REST API's consumption, Promises, Modules (ES6, AMD, CommonJS, npm, bower, browserify)<br>
CSS3 enhanced (modernizr, html5shiv, preprocessors: LESS, SASS/Compass)<br>
Enhancements, interaction and animation using custom CSS3, HTML5, and JS.<br>
Custom HTML5 Canvas and WebGL, SVG animation<br>
I've integrated front end to the following back end or enterprise tech stacks: I've obtained a deep working understanding of these stacks and can interface beyond front end with back end programmers: PHP, .NET, J2EE or Oracle, Rails, MongoDB, Redis.<br><br>


Javascript Frameworks Part 1:<br><br>

The following frameworks listed I have used extensively and deployed to production<br><br>
Templating: Handlebars.js, Jade<br>
Single Page App: Angular.js, Ember.js, node.js (I've used Ember for a large app, and Angular for smaller less<br>
complex projects).<br>
Node + Express + Jade<br>
Realtime and/or streams using Node / Socket.io<br>
MEAN stack or MEEN stack (Ember or Angular)<br>
Single Page App (mobile specific): Ionic + Angular, Ember + EmData , PhoneGap/Cordova<br>
Utilities using Underscore, lowdash, or micro helper APIs like Async, Promise, VideoJS, anything I can consume really.<br>
Animations using: Velocity.js, GSAP, Famo.us or native JS + CSS3<br>
Native JS animations using rAf + CSS3 Matrix 2d/3d (strive for no jank)<br>
Tooling using Grunt and framework specific CLIs<br>
DI and modularity using Node/npm, Bower, Browserify, Require<br>
Data rendering using D3 and HighCharts<br>
BAAS using Heroku<br><br>

Mobile Hybrid Apps:<br><br>

Multi device HTML5 app development:<br>
Phonegap / Cordova<br>
Ionic<br>
Ember + Ember-Data + Liquid-Fire + Custom CSS3<br>
Custom performant HTML5/CSS3/JS mobile development for web apps<br>
Rich HTML5 media (audio, video, media streaming, and animations + any util APIs)
Customized Canvas, HTML5 and CSS3 animation<br><br>

Javascript Frameworks Part 2:<br><br>

For the following frameworks listed, I have not used these in production. I only have self directed hacking or creative coding knowledge and experience. I achieved this through a combination of the JS community's patterns, framework/API docs and best practices. Mostly I used them to create basic CRUD, ToDoMVC or side projects. I have not had the chance to use these libraries or frameworks for client work as of yet. If you don't see it listed here, check further up in JS frameworks part 1 to see what I have used in production for client work.<br><br>

ES6, PhantomJS, Ember Canary<br>
View or SPA libraries: Knockout, React, Backbone, HTML Bars Middle: Hapi, Restify, Sails<br>
Realtime: Meteor<br>
Animations using: Famo.us, Three.js, WebGL<br>
Tooling using Gulp, Yeoman, and framework specific CLIs<br>
BAAS using Firebase, PubNub, and Parse<br><br>

Education<br><br>

Originally educated at Sheridan College in 2001, interactive development is an ever evolving trade that requires constant skill refinement, upgrading, and transformation. Using industry leaders in technology development as my guide, I have investigated every new adoption into our best practice patterns as they are absorbed into our web development culture. For example, as of today, my focus is on performance, browsers as platforms, platforms as services, web services, scalability, portability, rapid deployment, modularity, abstraction, and evangelism. Insert your technology of choice, HTML5, WebSockets, Meteor, Ember, Angular, Node, Web Components, and I've adopted it to my toolset to be called upon for the right job.<br>
I have to highlight how long I've been at this. I attended Colin Moock's actionscript bootcamp back in the day. And no, I don't do flash ☺, I mean, I can, if I had a gun to my head, but I highly advise against it. I'll redo anything you have in flash, in Canvas or HTML5.<br>
